Memo
Question 1
1.1 Three components of a DNA nucleotide:
? Deoxyribose sugar
? Phosphate group
? Nitrogenous base (A, T, C, or G)
1.2 Function of genes:
? Genes contain the instructions (code) for making proteins, which determine characteristics and cell functions.
1.3Difference between coding and non-coding DNA:
? Coding DNA contains genes that code for proteins.
? Non-coding DNA does not code for proteins but may regulate gene activity.
Question 2
2.1 Main DNA location and role:
? Most DNA is in the nucleus.
? It stores genetic information and controls cell activities.
2.2 Extranuclear DNA:
? DNA found outside the nucleus (e.g., in mitochondria or chloroplasts).
2.3 Mitochondrial DNA and ancestry:
? mtDNA is inherited from the mother and is useful in tracing maternal ancestry over generations.

Question 3
3.1 Two structural differences between DNA and RNA:
? RNA is single-stranded; DNA is double-stranded.
? RNA contains ribose sugar; DNA contains deoxyribose.
? RNA has uracil instead of thymine.
3.2 Types and locations of RNA:
? mRNA: Nucleolus and nucleus
? rRNA: Ribosomes in the cytoplasm
? tRNA: Cytoplasm
RNA base that replaces thymine:
? Uracil (U), which pairs with adenine (A)
Question 4
4.1 Function of mRNA:
? Carries the genetic message from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis.
4.2 Definition of transcription:
? The process where a section of DNA is copied into mRNA.
? Occurs in the nucleus.
4.3 Function of tRNA:
? Transfers specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the codons on mRNA.
4.4 Start and stop codons importance:
? Start codon (AUG) signals where translation begins.
? Stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) signal the end of protein synthesis.
4.5 Sequence of amino acids:
? Determined by the sequence of nucleotides (codons) on mRNA, which comes from DNA.

Question 5
5.1 Phase of DNA replication:
? Interphase (before mitosis begins)
5.2 Importance of DNA replication:
? Ensures that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genetic material.
5.3 What is DNA profiling?
? Analysis of DNA to identify individuals or determine relationships.
5.4 Example application:
? Solving paternity disputes, identifying crime suspects, or identifying missing persons.
