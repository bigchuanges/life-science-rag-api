1. Fossil = Remains or traces of organisms that lived millions of years ago.
Use = Show how organisms have changed over time and provide evidence of extinct species and evolutionary transitions.

2. Homologous = Same origin, different function (e.g., human arm and whale flipper).
Analogous = Different origin, same function (e.g., bird wing and insect wing).

3. Genetic variation = Provides different traits.
Natural selection acts on these differences, allowing better-adapted individuals to survive and reproduce.

4. Gradualism = Evolution occurs slowly and steadily.
Punctuated equilibrium = Long periods of no change are interrupted by short bursts of rapid change.

5. When a population is split by a barrier (e.g. river), they evolve separately. Over time, genetic differences accumulate, leading to new species.

6. Vestigial structure = A body part with no current function but inherited from ancestors.
Example = Appendix in humans.
Significance = Evidence of evolutionary change.

7. Artificial selection = Human-driven (e.g. breeding dogs).
Natural selection = Environment-driven (e.g. drought selecting for deep-rooted plants).

8. Mutations = Create new alleles and traits. If beneficial, these help organisms survive and can lead to the formation of a new species.

9. Some bacteria survive antibiotics due to a mutation. These resistant bacteria reproduce, passing on the resistance – an example of natural selection.

10. Darwin explained:
? Evolution happens due to natural selection, not just use/disuse.
? Traits are passed on genetically, not acquired.
? Supported by fossil evidence and variation in populations.
